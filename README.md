Script to add Themes in a TFS 2013 Team Project

This script automates the scenario described in this MSDN article (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn306083.aspx).

It adds a new Portfolio Backlog on top of the Feature, named 'Theme', and it supports the MSF for Agile and Visual Studio Scrum Process Templates only at the moment.
